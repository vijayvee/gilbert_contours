# Gilbert Contours
This repository contains code to recreate the contour stimuli used in the paper: [Global Contour Saliency and Local Colinear Interactions](https://www.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/jn.00289.2002).  
  
Code still in development, watch out for more organized code and cleaner stimuli.

Below is a sample of contours generated using this code.
